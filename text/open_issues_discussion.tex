% \section{Open Issues and Discussion}
% The results obtained by utilizing EARs in the context of IETS3 are
% promising. In particular, EARs being utilized, 1) as a structured
% requirements writing language as opposed to writing in natural language and, 2)
% to do automatic code synthesis from EARs specifications. However, using EARs in
% our context have also led us to have a list of interesting open issues and
% observations.
% The following is a non-exhaustive list of open issues and observations of EARs
% being utilized in the context of IETS3, 
% \begin{itemize}
%   \item Limited scope of translation controller generation. E.g. dealing with
%   parameters is not taken care of. (Is this an extensibility issue? can we
%   solve it by extending the language with parameters? is this an observation?)
%   \item Covering the gap between informal and formal -- how far can we get
%   without losing implicit information. Most of the organizations write
%   requirements in an unstructured/natural language. one of our
%   observations is that it is difficult for the companies to view immediate
%   benefits of adopting a structured/template language like EARs. For that
%   purpose, we would like to investigate further on how to close the gap between
%   natural/informal requirements and structured/template language like EARs so
%   that there is a minimal loss of information.
%   \item How generalizable is our approach? At present, we have applied our
%   approach for automatic code synthesis in the controller domain. We would like to investigate if our approach can
%   be generalized enough and can be utilized in other domains (e.g., writing test
%   cases).
%   \item Model checking is the next step. We would further like to investigate
%   how EARs can be helpful in performing the model checking.
%   \item Order is often important. It can be deduced from the context, but should
%   there be an implicit order? At present, we have written requirements using
%   EARs for controller generation purpose where the writing in a particular order might not that
%   important. However, it would be interesting to investigate further as to how
%   to prioritize/order the requirements when written in EARs for other domains?
%   FOr instance, this might be helpful in order to run test suites attached to
%   high-priority requirements.
%   \item Requirements are often not independent, we have observed during our
%   investigations that there is not an explicit way of having/managing
%   dependencies between requirements when written in EARs.
%   \item At present, EARs allow only discrete events (at any instance in time
%   as binary ON/OFF), how to have EARs for continuous (real-time) events in time?
