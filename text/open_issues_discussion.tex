\section{Open Issues and Discussion}

\begin{itemize}
  \item Limited scope of translation controller generation. E.g. dealing with
  parameters is not taken care of.
  \item Covering the gap between informal and formal -- how far can we get
  without losing implicit information.
  \item Can it be generalized?
  \item Order is often important. It can be deduced from the context, but should
  there be an implicit order?
  \item Model checking is the next step
  \item How generalizable is our approach?
\end{itemize}
